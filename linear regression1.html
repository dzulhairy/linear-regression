<h1>MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION (MODEL A- WITHOUT INTERACTION)</h1>
<p>Model A includes all covariates—age, sex, number of children, BMI, and smoking status—as predictors to examine their association with the outcome variable, health insurance charges. This approach aims to evaluate the contribution of each factor while controlling for the others in explaining variations in insurance costs.</p>

<h1>MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION (MODEL B- WITHINTERACTION)</h1>
<p>Model B is a multiple linear regression (MLR) model that includes an interaction term between age and smoking status. This decision is based on the premise that both variables—age and smoking status—have the potential to modify their combined effect on the outcome variable, health insurance charges</p>

<p>Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for the models were comparable, indicating similar overall model performance. For the ANOVA comparison, the p-value of 0.1317 suggests that the interaction term does not significantly improve the model. Consequently, the simpler model (MLR_modelA) was selected for its interpretability and practicality in explaining the relationship between covariates and the outcome.</p>

<p>The Q-Q plot indicates that the majority of the data points closely follow the diagonal line, suggesting that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. However, a small number of observations (specifically observations 243, 578, and 1301) exhibit large residuals, which may suggest potential outliers or influential data points.</p>

<li><p>The <strong>Adjusted R² = 0.845</strong>, indicating that approximately <strong>84.5% of the variance in the health insurance charges (outcome variable)</strong> is explained by the included predictors (age, sex, children, smoker, and BMI).</p></li>
<li><p>Every additional year of age, health insurance charges are expected to increase by USD 255, holding all other variables constant. The narrow confidence interval and highly significant p-value suggest a robust and reliable relationship between age and insurance charges.</p></li>
<li><p>Each additional child in the household is associated with an increase in health insurance charges of USD 392, holding other factors constant. The confidence interval is moderately narrow, and the relationship is statistically significant.</p></li>
<li><p>Smoking status, with non-smokers as the reference group, has the largest effect on health insurance charges among all the predictors. This indicates that smokers, on average, incur USD 24,072 more in health insurance charges compared to non-smokers, holding other variables constant. The narrow confidence interval and highly significant p-value highlight the substantial and reliable impact of smoking on charges.</p></li>
<li><p>Every one-unit increase in BMI, health insurance charges are expected to rise by USD 325, assuming all other factors remain constant. The confidence interval is relatively tight, and the relationship is statistically significant.</p></li>
<li><p>No significant difference in charges between males and females.</p></li>
